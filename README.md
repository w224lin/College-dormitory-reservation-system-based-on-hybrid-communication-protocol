# College-dormitory-reservation-system-based-on-hybrid-communication-protocol
In Linux environment, responsible for the design and implementation of a C++ based college dormitory booking system. The system architecture adopts a modular design, including client, server, and database server, which is committed to providing a safe and efficient dormitory query and reservation solution.

## Overview

This College-dormitory-reservation-system-based-on-hybrid-communication-protocol System is designed and implemented in C++ under the Linux environment. The system boasts a robust encryption/decryption mechanism to secure sensitive information and utilizes a modular architecture for efficient and secure operations. It features an innovative TCP/UDP mixed communication protocol, optimizing both security and efficiency in data transmission, and leverages advanced multi-threading and thread pool technologies for high concurrency and performance.

## Key Features

- **Advanced Encryption Mechanism**: Ensures all sensitive information transmitted via the client is encrypted securely.
- **Modular Design**: Comprising client, server, and database modules for a streamlined and secure operational flow.
- **Innovative Communication Protocol**: Utilizes a mixed TCP/UDP approach for the optimal balance of reliability and efficiency.
- **High-Concurrency Multithreading**: Employs cutting-edge thread pool technology to boost concurrency handling, enhancing system responsiveness and stability under high load.
